The latter two are your input files for [tbl2asn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tbl2asn2).\r\n\r\n\r\n## What It Does:\r\n\r\nWhen you run transvestigator, it reads the transcriptome into memory. It then fixes feature lengths, creates starts and stops, removes multiple CDS features, adjusts CDS phase, then writes a .fasta and .tbl file. If the directory contained a \"transcriptome.anno\" file, the .tbl file will contain functional annotations. If the directory contained a \"transcriptome.blacklist\" file, those transcripts will be excluded.\r\n\r\n#### Fix Feature Lengths\r\n\r\nIf the indices given for a gene, mRNA or CDS extend beyond the actual length of the sequence which contains them, the end index of the feature is adjusted to fall within the sequence boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Create Starts And Stops\r\n\r\nThe .tbl file indicates the presence of start and stop codons, but the .gff file associated with a transcriptome may not explicitly indicate the presence or absence of these features. So transvestigator inspects the first/last three bases of each CDS to determine whether they are a start/stop, then updates the transcriptome accordingly. This step is the key to eliminating the dreaded \"PartialProblem\" errors further downstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Remove Multiple CDS Features\r\n\r\nIf a transcript contains multiple CDS features, the longest one is chosen and the others are discarded. Future work may involve more complicated algorithms for making this decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Adjust CDS Phase\r\n\r\nA strange error arises in NCBI TSA submissions when a CDS begins at the second or third base of a sequence. The fix we apply changes the start index of the feature to 1 and adjusts its phase in order to compensate. This adds a \"codon_start\" annotation to the .tbl file and, more importantly, makes errors go away :)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
